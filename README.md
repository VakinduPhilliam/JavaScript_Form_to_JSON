# JavaScript_Form_to_JSON
Convert a user input into a JSON file using JavaScript.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON stores data that is both machine and human readable. 
JSON does this by formatting data as array text files.
This series of scripts is written to demonstrate the process of converting an input form into a JSON format and storing it as a local file.
The scripts make use of JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, HTML and JSON files.
The Script is written by Vakindu Philliam.
